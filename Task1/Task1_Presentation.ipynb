    "# Task 1 – Data Cleaning & Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "To clean and format the client-provided survey dataset into an SPSS-ready `.sav` file for Q import.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools Used:**  \n",
    "Python (pandas, numpy, pyreadstat)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of Steps**\n",
    "1. Remove invalid or incomplete records  \n",
    "2. Process multi-response questions  \n",
    "3. Convert text labels to numeric codes  \n",
    "4. Apply skip logic (Q1_99)  \n",
    "5. Rename and reorder columns  \n",
    "6. Create 'Wave' variable  \n",
    "7. Add variable and value labels  \n",
    "8. Export to `.sav`\n"

    "## Step 0 – Import Packages and Load Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting the data cleaning process, I first import all necessary Python libraries and my custom functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Imported Libraries\n",
    "- **pandas** – used for reading and transforming the Excel dataset into a DataFrame.  \n",
    "- **numpy** – provides numerical operations such as handling missing values (`NaN`) and creating new columns efficiently.  \n",
    "- **pyreadstat** – enables exporting the cleaned dataset to SPSS (`.sav`) format with correct labels and value codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Custom Functions from `Task1.py`\n",
    "The script `Task1.py` contains all the cleaning functions I previously built.  \n",
    "By importing them here, I can execute each step interactively in Jupyter Notebook and show how the dataset changes after every operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions imported:\n",
    "- `remove_invalid_cases()` – removes logic errors and incomplete rows  \n",
    "- `process_multiresponse_questions()` – splits multi-response questions into binary columns  \n",
    "- `convert_labels_to_codes()` – maps text answers to numeric codes  \n",
    "- `apply_q1_99_skip_logic()` – applies skip rules for respondents selecting “None of these”  ( (:P)Forgot to find this error logic until checking)\n",
    "- `rename_and_reorder_columns()` – renames variables and adjusts their order  \n",
    "- `create_wave_variable()` – creates the weekly ‘Wave’ variable from `CompletedDate`  \n",
    "- `create_labels()` – builds variable and value label dictionaries for SPSS  \n",
    "- `save_to_spss()` – exports the cleaned dataset with labels into `.sav`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading the Raw Dataset\n",
    "The raw Excel file, **`EXAMPLE DATA FILE.xlsx`**, is then read using `pandas.read_excel()` to inspect its structure and confirm that all expected columns are present before cleaning begins.\n"
