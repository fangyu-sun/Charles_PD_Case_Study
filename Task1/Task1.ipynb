    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "To clean and format the client-provided survey dataset into an SPSS-ready `.sav` file for Q import.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools Used:**  \n",
    "1. **Python** (pandas, numpy, pyreadstat,re,os,datetime)\n",
    "2. **Excel** (for data validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summraised Logical Notes (Errors might be found):**\n",
    "1. **Check screening variables** ‚Äì Gender, Age, Postcode, or CompletedDate not provided.\n",
    "2. **Age under 18 respondents** ‚Äì \"Under 18\" should be terminated.  \n",
    "3. **Brand awareness conflict** Selected \"None of these\"(Q1_99) but still answered Q2‚ÄìQ5.  \n",
    "4. **Brand usage conflict** Not ‚ÄúOrigin‚Äù users (Q2 ‚â† 4) but still answered Q3‚ÄìQ5.  \n",
    "5. **Advertising conflict** Said *‚ÄúNo‚Äù* or *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know‚Äù* in Q6 but still answered Q7.\n",
    "6. **Inconsistent brand awareness** If selected ‚ÄúNone of these‚Äù (Q1_99) ,then should not selected other brands in Q1 .\n",

    "**Overview of Steps**\n",
    "1. Constructing Input and Output Paths \n",
    "2. Read raw data \n",
    "3. Clean column names and remove leading/trailing spaces and replace non-standard quotes \n",
    "4. Data cleaning and format conversion \n",
    "5. Export to SPSS file (.sav)\n",
    "6. Display the ratio of Origin users vs. non-Origin users\n",
    "7. Display inspection results for all text columns\n",
